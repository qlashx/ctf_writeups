**It told me I'm not allowed to know the secret, and the title was "Access Denied"**

**Then a question crossed my mind: how does he know that I'm not allowed to see the secret? The answer lay in the session.**

**I obtained the session, and it turned out to be a JWT session**

**after decodeing  the session using jwt.io it looked like this**

**so here i saw a role in the data and the traget is to get the secret and change our role to NineTails**

**so i used hashcat to crack the jwt and get the secret**

**After this i used this python code to get generate a new jwt token**

`
**And it gave me this token ->eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6Ik5hcnV0byIsInJvbGUiOiJOaW5lVGFpbHMifQ.rDZ26ZE_F4l0Ve4E-2sKP4qKNuadhLU8nrThW7YGVPg**

**And then i replace the token on the website with the one that i genertae and tried to access the secret_of_Kurama end point** 

**And pingo it wokred and the secert was the flag :D**
